          <b><h1>HAPPY 7TH MONTHS OF LOVE<br></h1></b>
          I'm writing this message in my birthday because that day I am super bored which is keep talking to you that day.
          Well, I'm Happy that morning or afternoon cuz you greet and sing me happy birthday.
          Still having a hard time on doing what do I want to do but yeah it is now better than that time. Still developing the words, sentences and paragraph on this.
         
          <br><br> I figure something that when I talk in an english way you said it is hot. Well, I'm hot and handsome in your eyes so can't be helped.
          As you can see this website is simple design but I'm working on it. I want to improve this or make a new one till it reached our 1st year Anniversary.
          Also, you're gonna be 16 this year on March 31 which is I know hehe.

          <br><br> I do want to catch up on your hobbies, still working on it. I do have a lot of questions prepared on my notes and I keep stacking them till this day.
          It was fun that month, which is December, I received a bracelet still wearing it. It is minimalist, which is I like it, but you know if you have something like a t-shirt or hoodie like you got name on it or face, I WOULD LOVE TO WEAR IT.

          <br><br>I'm writing this in JAN 2 - 3:19AM, I'm wondering what do you want in life? Well, my natatandaan pa naman ako sa mga sinabi mo that time if nasa atin na lahat. You said that you want to enjoy it nalang kasi nasayo na financials everything as in.
          2025 that year is really fun, I got a special gift which is you my girlfriend and soon to be my fiancee ahhh... Kinikilig to (corny ko pala). Pustahan ayieee okay ama na WHHAHAHAH. Siguro minsan ko nalang gawin tong ganitong message.
         
          <br><br>Alam mo ba na if ever may mga times na malungkot ako at syempre namimiss kita puno yung utak ko sa ganito ganyan maybe sulatan nalang kita for you to read kasi mahilig ka magbasa eh.
          Hindi lang sa stories syempre pati rin sa stories ng ibang tao and we called it chismis.
         
          <br><br>Oo nga pala SPOTIFY, di kana naglalagay doon ah, may utang ka nanaman saakin. "Utang nanaman lagi nalang may utang" Sensya na ah pero WELP it can't b- ahhh alam mo ah WHAHAHHA. Maybe I'm planning to go BIG this year LIKE YOU WANTED TO.
          Since tatanda nanaman ang baby na yan.          
         
          <br><br>May mga nights na like this or early morning ganon. Sometimes I wish sana ikaw nalang yung katabi ko sa higaan ko, gabing malamig kayakap ka at kapag nalulungkot ako. Syempre ina-alala rin kita no...
          Sana andyan ako para lutuan ka ng sabaw, makapag bonding tayo and do something fun alam mo yun. Pero sana ikaw pa rin while tinutupad ko pangarap ko, panagarap mo at pangarap natin.
         
          <br><br>Sometimes I don't know how to cheer you up but I'm trying. I don't want to see my baby to be sad or cry. It's hard and easy I just can't explain it.
          The only thing I know if I let you do your hobbies or give you some space it will cheer you up, and sometimes I want to buy you some food or drinks for the cravings, but I can't because the money is the main problem.
          But I promised you I will find a way learning every behavior that you had in you. I love you.

          <br><br>To end this drama or yes, this message/letter, to payback to all the mistakes that I've done to you.
          Still trying to repay you know UTANG ko sayo which is ambigat masyado MALAKING UTANG actually. Di ko na binago masyado kasi blanko utak ko ngayon kaya here. Also, I'm trying to fix the problems saakin and to be the best boyfriend for you:DDD
          Happy 7th Monthsarry again to us my baby, I love you so much mwa mwa mwa.

          <br><br>- [kung anong tawag mo saakin] Wann
