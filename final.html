          <b><h1>HAPPY 7TH MONTHS OF LOVE<br></h1></b>
          I'm writing this message in my birthday because that day I am super bored which is keep talking to you that day.
          Well I'm Happy that morning or afternoon cuz you greet and sing me happy birthday.
          Still having a hard time on doing what do I want to do but yeah it is now better than that time. Still developing the words, sentences and paragraph on this.
          
          <br><br> I figure something that when I talk in a english way you said it is hot. Well I'm hot and handsome in your eyes so can't be helped.
          As you can see this website is simple there not much design but I'm working on it. I want to improve this till it reached our 1st year Anniversary.
          Also you're gonna be 16 this year on March 31 which is I know hehe.

          <br><br> I do want to catch up on your hobbies but I can't, I want to but I can't. I do have a lot of questions prepared on my notes and I keep stacking them if you got time on me.
          It was fun that month which is December, I received a bracelet still wearing it. It is minimalist which is I like it but you know if you have something like a t-shirt or hoodie like you got name on it or face I WOULD LOVE TO WEAR IT.
          That's on this day:DDD
