          My love, I just want you to know how much you mean to me. Every moment with you feels like magic. Your smile, your laugh, your kindness — they light up my world in ways I never imagined.<br><br>
          I remember the first time we talked, and how instantly I felt connected to you. Since then, every day has been a beautiful chapter in our story. You’ve shown me what true love feels like, and I’m endlessly grateful.<br><br>
          Even when things get tough, I know we’ll get through it together. You’re my strength, my peace, and my joy. I promise to always be here for you, to support you, and to love you with all my heart.<br><br>
          I dream of a future where we chase our goals side by side, laugh until we cry, and build a life full of warmth and adventure. You inspire me to be better, and I want to grow with you every step of the way.<br><br>
          So here’s my heart, wrapped in this little letter. I love you more than words can say — and I always will. ❤️
